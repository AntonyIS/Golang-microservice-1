A simple microservice app to show case usage 
* Golang
* Gin (Golang REST API libray)
* Docker 
* Postgresql

## Golang
Golang used the run time programming language because its compile time is fast.

## Gin 
Gin is the most common Golang REST API . It has been used because of its simplicity over other REST API framewor out there(My opinion :))

## Docker
Writen in Golang, Docker has been used for containerization technology. Two images are created for this system :
* Golang Image
* React Image

## Postgresql
Used to storing data entered by the users, Other data bases can be used as well. It easy to setup Postgresql with Golang

## Nginx
